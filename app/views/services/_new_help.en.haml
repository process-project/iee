      To register a service, you must provide a unique name and a URI.
    %p
      Once you register a service, you automatically become its owner and will be able to manage its properties.
      Additionally, the
      %b service secret token
      will be autogenerated upon service creation.
    %p
      Service-specific access methods are names of methods provided by the service - these can include standard
      REST interface methods such as
      %b PUT, POST, DELETE
      etc., or other methods specific to your type of service (e.g.
      %b SELECT, UPDATE
      etc. for a relational database). These methods are listed here in order to facilitate definition of
      security policies applicable to the service (since each policy applies to a specific set of access methods).
